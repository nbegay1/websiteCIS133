        <p>Her real name was Amonute but she was known as Matoaka, which means “flower between two streams.” She was born between the two rivers of Mattaponi and Pamunkey, where she got her name. Matoaka was one of the first MMIWG in the late 1600s. The story of Matoaka (pocohantas) is a tragic tale of the young Native girl who was kidnapped, sexually assaulted, and allegedly murdered by those who were supposed to keep her safe. </p>
